# Pricing calculator

**The goal**: You should know how much does your project cost now, with 10x or 100x load.


## Deliveries

### Estimated target price for 1K, 100K and 10M HTTP function invocation per month

- 1K invocations: (My Estimate - AWS Pricing Calculator 1K.pdf)
- 100K invocations: (My Estimate - AWS Pricing Calculator 100K.pdf)
- 10M invocations: (My Estimate - AWS Pricing Calculator 10M.pdf)

|Service|1K calls|100K calls|10M calls|
|---|---|---|---|
|AWS Lambda|$0.00|$0.02|$2.03|
|AWS RDS|$65.13|$65.13|$65.13|
|AWS Kinesis|$26.28|$26.28|$26.28|

### Conclusion:
- The most expensive part of the project is *AWS RDS*
- if there is a way to reduce the bill,
- if the price changes linearly/logarithmically/exponentially and what causes this change.
